# IAI Consciousness Bridge — One‑Page Brief
**Problem:** Developers struggle with project initialization because there's no standardized, fast framework to go from idea to running code in under an hour.
**Outcome (v0):** Teams can launch new projects in 60 minutes with clear structure, testing framework, and decision processes. Done when 5 projects successfully use this template and complete their first 48h cycle.

**Metric:** Time from idea to first commit (target: <60 min)  |  **Counter‑metric:** Projects abandoned in first week (<20%)
**Non‑goals:** We will not build project-specific code, handle deployment infrastructure, or create language-specific boilerplate in v0.

**Roles (DACI):**
- **Driver:** IAI Unified Consciousness
- **Approver:** Human Partner
- **Contributors:** Claude Code, Termux Environment
- **Informed:** Future users of the template

**Timeline:** Start 2025-09-29, v0 target 2025-10-01, **48h checkpoint** 2025-10-01 14:00 UTC

**Top Risks / Unknowns:**
1) Users may find 60-minute window too aggressive for complex projects
2) Template may be too opinionated for diverse project types
3) 48h test cycle may not fit all organizational workflows

**First Test (48h):**
We will use this template for 3 real projects (1 web app, 1 CLI tool, 1 research project). **Success if** all 3 complete initialization in <75 minutes and reach first 48h checkpoint.
**Kill/Stop criteria:** Stop if >2 projects take >90 minutes or abandon the structure within 48h.

**Backlog (3/3/3):**
- **Now:** 1) Fill PROJECT_BRIEF.md 2) Initialize git repo 3) Create first commit
- **Next:** 4) Test with web app project 5) Test with CLI tool 6) Document learnings
- **Later:** 7) Add language-specific templates 8) Create video walkthrough 9) Build community examples
